# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Shane Gray. I have two cats, a dog, and a rabbit. I enjoy spending time with my partner and my daughter; we love playing Pokemon Go together. I enjoy studying and practicing Buddhism, and the same with Muay Thai. I'm vegan, and love cooking, and the challenges and rewards that come with preparing and cooking vegan dishes.
